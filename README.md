# React Gallery App

## About this project

In this site you can search images. In each page you can see up to 20 images. the quality of the image is based on the height of the image. for example for Images that are taller than 3000px the image quality is higher, this way you are not going to see a low quality image in the site.

- all images are provided from [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/, "pexels") Api.

> If you hover on each image you are going to see the photographer name

> If you click on an image it will open up a page dedicated to that image, showing a high quality version of that image. in that page if you clock on the name of the photographer it will open the page of that photographer in [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/, "pexels").

I used React Router for the site which means all the pages are being handle by Front-End
